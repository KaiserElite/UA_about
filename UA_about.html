        <header><h2>Deck Building</h2></header>
        <p>In Union Arena, a deck consists of 50 cards and 3 action points. Decks must be created within the same title (ex. you can only have Bleach cards within a Bleach deck) with the only exception being action points as they are more merely meant for decoration between the different titles. You are allowed to have different colors of the same title within the same deck but keep in mind you will still need the necessary color energy to play those cards (ex. 1 cost green cards cannot use yellow as energy cost)</p>
        <p>You are allowed up to 4 copies of the same card and alternate arts of certain cards count to the main count of the base card. If you look at the bottom of your cards, certain cards will have "triggers". When deck building, you are only allowed 4 of each of the following triggers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Color Triggers</li>
          <li>Final Triggers</li>
          <li>Special Triggers</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Turn_Phase">
        <header><h2>Turn Phase</h2></header>
        <p> Player 1 gets access to 1 Action Point at the start of the turn, Player 2 gets access to 2 Action Point on the first turn. Then the amount of Action Point each player has is equal the the current turn they are on (ex. on turn two both player 1 and player 2 has access to 2 Action Points) up to a maximum of 3 Action Points.<p>
        <p class="no-indent">Each turn starts off the same for each player:</p>
        <ul class="turn-list">
          <li><span class="bold">Draw Phase</span>: Player draws a card for their turn. Player then can choose to pay 1 Action Point to draw an additional card (can only be done once).</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Movement Phase</span>: Players can move any characters from the energy line up to the attack line. However, only characters with the <span class="special">STEP</span> attribute can move from the attack line back to the energy line.
          <li><span class="bold">Main Phase</span>: Players can play characters, site, and events during this phase. All characters and site will be played set unless the card specifically says "This card plays active". Any cards that have <i>Activate Main</i> can be activated so long as the words <i>Rest this card</i> does not follow suit.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Attacking Phase</span>: Players can choose the order of which character attacks first.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the end/start of each turn. All characters and Action Points will restand back to active unless said otherwise. Players cannot go backwards in the orders (ex. moving a character back and forth when a new character/event/site has been played).</p>
        <p>The win condition is to make your opponent lose all their lives. In the case that the timer goes off, the following are the overtime rules:</p>
        <ul class="turn-list">
          <li><span class="bold">0 1 2 3 rule</span>: Current turn player is on turn 0 and when it is the next player's turn, turn 1 starts, then back and forth one more turn for 4 turns total. The one with more life at the end of the 4 turns wins the game</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Deck Size</span>: In the event of a tie between lives, the player with the most cards in their current deck wins the game</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Rock Papers Scissors</span>: Weirdly enough, if there is a tie between deck sizes, then play a game of rock paper scissors to decide winner</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Attacking_and_Defending">
        <header><h2>Attacking and Defending</h2></header>
        <p>When attacking, the player cannot choose who they want to target unless they have <span class="special">SNIPE</span>. This means that the choice of defending is up to their opponent.</p>
        <p>Opponents have the choice of whether or not they want to defend an attack with a character or take a life. If the defending character has a greater BP than the attacking character, the attacked is blocked and the defending character is set to rest. However if the blocking character has less than or equal BP to the attacking character, the blocking character will be sidelined.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Triggers">
        <header><h2>Triggers</h2></header>
        <p>Triggers are activated when a player takes a life and the card that is chosen has a trigger effect. Players can choose whether or not to activate said trigger. If a player gets damaged multiple times from one attack (ex. <span class="special">DAMAGE 2</span>, <span class="special">IMPACT 2</span>, or such), then flip 2 cards and choose the order of how each trigger is activated. Each trigger does a different ability:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="trigger">Final Trigger</span>: If this was the player's last life, then obtain the top card of the deck and place it towards the life area essentially healing the player by 1</li>
          <li><span class="trigger">Color Trigger</span>: Each color has a different ability listed</li>
          <li><span class="trigger">Special Trigger</span>: Target one of your opponent's character and sideline it</li>
          <li><span class="trigger">Active Trigger</span>: Target one character on your side and give +3000 BP and set character to active if it is currently rested</li>
          <li><span class="trigger">Draw Trigger</span>: Draw a card</li>
          <li><span class="trigger">Get Trigger</span>: Add the card to your hand</li>
          <li><span class="trigger">Raid Trigger</span>: Raid target if base character exists on the field and if you have the required energy. If not, add the card to your hand</li>
        </ul>
